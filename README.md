# cairoshell.flat-minimal
Theme for [Cairo Shell](https://github.com/cairoshell/cairoshell)
![Theme Preview]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shan-sherif/cairoshell.flat-minimal/refs/heads/main/Preview.png")
Based on Flat Accent theme, I have made the Menu bar and Taskbar solid black as well as changing the Logo and font.

## Instructions
Download the files in the Assets folder (flat_minimal.xaml & Logo_Square.ong) and move them to the themes folder in Cairoshell (It should be in Program Files/Cairo Shell/Themes).
If your installation folder is different, you will need to edit the BitmapImage on line 120 of Flat_Minimal.xaml to match the location of the logo image.
Once this is done, head to Cairo Settings -> General -> Theme. Change to Flat_Minimal.
If the theme looks like the default Cairo Shell theme, you might need to check and see if the location of the logo (Logo_Square.png) is correct.
